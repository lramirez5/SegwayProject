1. Auth blk. I don't know how to make a self check with modules inside the DUT in testbench
-> sending 'g' then stop sending, pwr_up is 1, checked
-> then send 's', pwr_up returned to 0, state is OFF, checked
-> check other states. send rideroff signal: I don't know how to do yet.
-> TX_RX signal from UART to Auth Blk seems wierd but might be correct
2. balance control, Inert_intf, mtr_drv
put them through their own tb and they seem correct.

TODO
Modify ADC128S > MIN RIDER WEIGHT 
piezo and piezo_n not behaving correctly
With sudden increase in positive rider lean, theta platform behaving in wierd wave shape
